# python-interview-code-challenge-002
Takehome challenge for the python interview at iTexico

## The Purpose
Assess your skills and knowledge on the python language

## The Challenge

1.- Create a simple server with a rest endpoint at "/api/anagram"
2.- Create a method that, given an array of strings, returns groups of strings that are anagrams of each other
3.- Bind this method to be the resolver of the "/api/anagram" endpoint you created
4.- Create a simple test that tests against your endpoint

## The Rules

- Fork this repository when you start.
- Create a Pull Request labeled as **WIP:<Your Name> - Python Challenge 002** as soon as you start (it can be an empty Pull Request, as in, no commits are needed)
- Create a commit for each step solved (so, 4 commits total)
- You can use any library or framework available, or no library or framework at all, it's your call
- Have fun
  
## The Assessment
This small challenge serves the single purpose of understanding how you code and how you approach problems, and is followed by a second interview exploring areas of the solution you provide, so it is important that the solution is of your own making.

### Parameters to be assessed:

- Code works, solution solves the problem
- Code is tested (a single test will do to pass the challenge, but knowing how to write tests in general is a must)
- Code is clean and readable
- Approach

# Have fun coding!
